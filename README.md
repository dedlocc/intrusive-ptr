# intrusive-ptr

An alternative implementation of
[intrusive_ptr](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_71_0/libs/smart_ptr/doc/html/smart_ptr.html#intrusive_ptr) 
and [intrusive_ref_counter](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_71_0/libs/smart_ptr/doc/html/smart_ptr.html#intrusive_ref_counter), 
as well as some utilities related to them.

The purpose of this implementation is to consolidate my understanding of relaxed atomics.
